# 🌍 Ismail Mazumder — Data Visualizations

Welcome to my GitHub page!

Here, I visualize real-world datasets on **wars**, **conflicts**, **deaths**, **economy**, **crime**, and **more** through intuitive and interactive charts.  
My mission is to make complex historical and modern data **easy to understand** and **visually engaging** for everyone.
